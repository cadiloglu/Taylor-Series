# Taylor-Series
Approximating sine and cosine functions by using Taylor series.
The user must enter a "D" character, an input in terms of degree and n number which defines the first n elements respectively. 
Also before calculation, the degree input is converted into radian value.
While calculating the factorial and exponent of a number, I wrote my own code, didn't use functions in math library for these
calculations. Also, application waits input from user until user enters 'E' character.
The formulas that I used and the details about the project are at "Homework Document.pdf"'s 2nd part.
